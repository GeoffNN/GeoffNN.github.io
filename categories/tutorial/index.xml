      <description>Hi everyone, welcome back. Tonight I was having dinner with some engineer friends (sadly not a plat en sauce) and the subject of Machine Learning popped up.

All in all, it made me feel that even engineers have a very vague sense of what exactly is Machine Learning.</description>
